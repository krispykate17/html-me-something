					<a name="german"></a>
					<h2>German</h2>
					<p>My first foreign language. I chose it in highschool over Spanish and French because
					I was told it was more difficult and I like a challenge! Besides, I knew if I could master 
					it, then I could always learn other languages later. I spent 2 years following regular coursework.
					The last 2 years I had schedule conflicts but still wanted to take it, so they allowed me to 
					take it as a dual enrolled student at St. Charles Community College. After that, I continued
					to try taking courses throughout my undergrad, and came close to having enough credits for a
					minor, but again, the scheduling just never lined up. Sadly, this led to me losing touch with 
					the language, but I hope to one day be able to pick it back up.</p>

					<h2>French</h2>
					<p>I started taking French senior year of highschool. People thought I was crazy
					for taking more than one foreign language. Honestly, I would've started taking
					French even sooner if my schedule and counselor would've allowed it. I caught on
					very quickly to French and it felt more natural to me than German. Not only that,
					but it worked into my schedule better because more courses were offered in my
					undergrad... and I eventually switched majors to the point where my undergrad degree
					is now in Modern Languages with an emphasis in French! I now try to keep up with it
					by listening to podcasts, music, watching tv, reading news articles, and I try to get
					to Montreal as often as I can!</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<a name="chinese"></a>
					<h2>Chinese</h2>
					<p>Naturally, I wanted to learn an Eastern language to pair with my knowledge of 
					English and French. Even though Japanese has always been a dream and goal, the 
					not-fun, logical part of my brain said &quot;Learn Chinese! It will be more useful and 
					you can get a better job!&quot;</p>
					<p><strong><center>Well... I said, &quot;Yolo! Let's go to China and learn Chinese!&quot;</center></strong></p>
					<p>There were a few more steps involved, but that was essentially it. I took a
					crash course in Chinese at UMSL to prepare for my trip which involved 8 credit hours
					worth of material mashed into 3 credit hours mashed into 4 weeks.</p>
					<p>I was supposed to be in China for a semester... only made it 2 weeks. One day I'll
					write a book about it. For now, just know it was nightmarish, and I don't know that
					I'll ever go back.</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<a name="c++"></a>
					<h2>C++</h2>
					<p>Ahhh my first attempt at learning a coding language! It was one of the few
					programming courses offered at UMSL at the time. So why programming?</p>
					<ol>
						<li>It's not so far off from learning a human language.</li>
						<li>It uses both creativity and logic.</li>
						<li>I've taken several personality job assesment skills. Every single one
						recommended programming. Go figure!</li>
					</ol>
					<p>So I decide to give programming a try... and I hated it! I was stuck in a class
					filled with math and engineering majors who couldn't care less about programming, and 
					were just there because it was required. The teacher knew it too. So I tried my best, 
					but it wasn't a great starting environment and the only joy I got from it was putting
					silly &quot;Archer&quot; references in my projects so my teacher and I could get a laugh.</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<a name="python"></a>
					<h2>Python</h2>
					<p>Winter 2016, I decided my initial opinion of programming probably
					wasn't acurate and that I just needed a new environment to learn. Enter
					in LaunchCode! I saw that they were accepting applications for LC101 and 
					so I applied.</p>
					<p>Well, I was right! It makes a world of difference to learn with others
					who are just as passionate about the subject as you are. Especially, when
					trying to tackle such an intimidating and huge subject like computer science.</p>
					<p>Python was a breeze compared to C++ and I felt the language itself and the 
					way it was presented, really helped me grasp concepts I never would've understood
					on my own.</p>
					<p><strong><center>Thanks LaunchCode!</center></strong></p>

				<section>
					<a name="japanese"></a>
					<h2>Japanese</h2>
					<p>I believe my love of language/cultures/travel stemmed from the moment my 
					grandparents came back from Japan in 1998. My 5 year old self thought it was 
					the most amazing thing when they came back with silk kimonos, wooden shoes, paper 
					umbrellas, and of course... pikachu earmuffs!!!</p>
					<p>I then had a Japanese friend in elementary school who introduced me to the 
					world of Sailor Moon. I was completely hooked on Japanese pop culture after that.</p>
					<p>As of right now, I don't know much Japanese, and it's a work in progress.
					I hope to know enough to travel to Japan by Spring 2018!</p>
